# Simple Semantic Search Engine powered by OpenAI Embeddings & internal search 

## Requirements
An OpenAI API key. The key should be referenced through configuration using a "openai.api.key" property

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how, on a small scale, one can integrate semantic search into a Spring Boot (or any Java) application using Embeddings generated by OpenAI. 

As an example, we create a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for a fictitious Solar Panel supply company.
